# ðŸš€ messaging - A simple messaging bus

This project is a library which provides a jms like messaging
between different isolation layers in a web page...

The ideas is that mÃ©ssages are sent via different channels
and then ever isolation layer can subscribe to those channels
and receive the messages. Or send messages back into the channel.

What can be bridged

* normal dom elements within a single document
* iframes 
* shadow html closed and open
* popups (very likely, they use the same mechanisms as iframe, not tested though)

What cannot be bridged. Everything which is not connected on the same document
one way or the other aka, either has no direct dom connection or the parent
has no window/shadowRoot/dom reference to the other isolated part!


## building the library

```
npm run build
```



to bundle the library application


## Usage

### Brokers,  Channel Groups, Channels, Messages and Listeners


#### Broker
Brokers are the central hook point into the message bus
they are responsible for sending and receiving the messages
and for distributing them over the boundaries.

Every isolation layer needs one or more brokers (usually one)


Brokers being able to communicate with each other, usually 
are combined in channel groups.

#### Channel Group

A channel group is an identifier which
combines a set of brokers which can share channels.

Channel groups are isolated from each other


#### Channel
A Channel is a communication channel to share messages.
Messages sent to a channel can be listened to by all receivers
registered into a broker.


Per default all brokers share a common broker group so in normal
cases you only have to deal with brokers and channels.
But sometimes it is desireable to have another layer of isolation
granularity hence the concect of channel groups was introduced



#### Messages

Messages: Message units containing data and the channel name they should be sent to

#### Listeners

Ever broker has one or more listeners listening to channels
a channel name of * means receive all messages
or send to

shadowBroker.broadcast(CHANNEL, new Message("booga2"), Direction.DOWN);

### usage


For receiving and sending data perform following operation
* define a new broker with a reference to your isolation root (no isolation root means window)
* register listeners via the registerListener method
* for sending use the broadcast method!


### Transports and Broker Types

To transmit messages within a browser there can be various means of transport.
I am aware that there is no one fits for all solution.
When I started this module, I thought to provide such a solution but after doing research
I came to the conclusion that basic channel messaging already is covered by third party libraries
and partially browser apis. 
So I left it open  what to use and provided two basic implementations

Both broker types implement the same core api
they have the same channel/channel group functionality (something which extends on existing mechanisms)
but they do not relay messages automatically, if you want to relay messages you 
have to add specialized listeners which then relay the mssage from one broker system into another.

However normally this is not needed, once settled on a transport you hardly mix other transports in!


#### The basic Broker
This is a simple broker which uses basic dom mechanisms to relay the messages

#### The BroadcastChannelBroker

Which uses an existing (almost every browser by now has one) implementation 
of the broadcast channel api.
For browsers which do not use it, shims are available:
[see this link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/broadcast-channel)



### Example:

```typescript
 let broker1 = new Broker();//define a broker with a window context
 let shadowBroker = new Broker(shadowRoot, "shadow");    //define a broker with a shadow root reference and a channel grup

 /*
  * registers a listener on the channel
  */   
 shadowBroker.registerListener(CHANNEL, (msg: Message) => {
    shadowBrokerReceived++;
 });
 /*
  * send a message into the messag bus, direction up from the current position
  * possible directions UP, DOWN, ALL, default if no value is given
  * is all, which is the behavior expected from a one dimensional bus
  * UP and down introduces a two dimensional behavior allowing a direction within the 
  * dom hierarchy where the message has to be processed from the current position
  * (aka subbus behavior)
  *
  * Also not the issuing broker never receives the message it sends 
  * out... only the others do
  */ 
 shadowBroker.broadcast(CHANNEL, new Message("booga2"), Direction.UP);

 shadowBroker.unregister(); //unregisters the current broker from the existing dom isolation layer
 //in case of a destruction of the layer referenced the deregistration happens automatically
```

Request and answer:
On top of the usual channel/listener api a request
anser api has been provided

````typescript
        let broker = new BroadcastChannelBroker();
        let broker2 = new BroadcastChannelBroker();
        let answerReceived = false;
        broker2.registerListener("channel", (message: Message): void => {
            setTimeout(() => broker2.answer("channel", message, new Message("answer of booga")), 0);
        })

        return broker.request("channel", new Message("booga"))
            .then((message2: Message) => {
                answerReceived = message2.message === "answer of booga";
                expect(answerReceived).to.be.true;
                return true;
            }).finally(() => {
                broker.unregister();
                broker2.unregister();
            });
````

As we can see here, we have two brokers and a request is sent into the channel
and an answer is sent back. The requesting broker
then has a promise which waits until the first answer is received
and processes it.
Note this is happens on a first served base if multiple answers are sent.
If you need to collect answer data from more than one
answer sources, you have to use a standard channel listener mechanism.

The request answer mechanism is seen as a simple way to query global data


### API


```typescript
export declare enum Direction {
    UP = 0,
    DOWN = 1,
    ALL = 2
}
/**
 * a standardized message to be sent over the message bus
 */
export declare class Message {
    message: any;
    channel: string;
    creationDate?: number;
    identifier?: string;
    targetOrigin?: string;
    constructor(channel: string, message?: any, targetOrigin?: string);
}
/**
 * central message broker which uses various dom constructs
 * to broadcast messages into subelements
 *
 * we use the dom event system as transport and encapsule iframe and shadow dom mechanisms in a transparent way to
 * pull this off
 *
 * usage
 *
 * broker = new Broker(optional rootElement)
 *
 * defines a message broker within a scope of rootElment (without it is window aka the current isolation level)
 *
 * broker.registerListener(channel, listener) registers a new listener to the current broker and channel
 * broker.unregisterListener(channel, listener) unregisters the given listener
 *
 * broker.broadcast(channel, message, optional direction, optional callBrokerListeners)
 * sends a message (channel included in the message object) in a direction (up, down, both)
 * and also optionally calls the listeners on the same broker (default off)
 *
 * the flow is like
 * up messages are propagated upwards only until it reaches the outer top of the dom
 * downards, the messages are propagaed downwards only
 * both the message is propagated into both directions
 *
 * Usually messages sent from the same broker are not processed within... however by setting
 * callBrokerListeners to true the listeners on the same broker also are called
 * brokers on the same level will get the message and process it automatically no matter what.
 * That way you can exclude the source from message processing (and it is done that way automatically)
 *
 * Isolation levels. Usually every isolation level needs its own broker object registering
 * on the outer bounds
 *
 * aka documents will register on window
 * iframes on the iframe windowObject
 * isolated shadow doms... document
 *

export declare class Broker {
    channelGroup: string;

     */
    answer(channel: string, request: Message, answer: Message): Broker;

}
```
Note, the standard broker works over dom mechanisms.
However, a secondary broker has been provided which 
allows the same over export class BroadcastChannel api.
The BroadcastChannelBroker!

This broker allows to use Broadcast channels (shim 
or native, or even passed as argument)
and uses this transport mechanism, and addes the extended
message response on top.


## Messaging Encryption
### General Info
Given that we can use various means of transport, encrypting the messages
might become mandatory (some transports use other means of storage)

For this a basic crypto api has been enabled but without a full implementation.

The head is to pass a basic crypto object into the constructor of the Broker
which then is used for encryption and decryption of the messages.

Whatever you use and how you encrypt the messages is up to you.
However note basic message data is passed, and this does not necessarily mean
that you can expect strings.

Also the return object just is returned as is, and the only requirement must be
it must by json stringifyable.

Also some factories were added to ease the broker construction.

So in the end we have a very simple api as following:

### API

```typescript
/**
 * generic crypto interface
 * to encrypt messages before they are sent
 * to the message bus oder the underlying bus system
 *
 * The idea is to make it as easy as possible, you can use for instance crypto js to
 * handle everything
 */
export interface Crypto {
    
    /**
     * note anything can be passed
     *
     * @param data the data to be encrypted
     * @returns the encrypted data in any format, important is decode must be able to handle it
     */
    encode(data: any): any;

    /**
     * @param data the encrypted data in the format you expect it to be
     * @returns the unencrypted data
     */
    decode(data: any): any;
}
```
For some crypto implementations a generic hash generator which needs to be provided can come in handy
for this reason whe have provided a hash api without concrete implementation for now:

```typescript
/**
 * generic hash interface which provides
 * exactly one method a hash encode which returns a string hash value of encoded data
 */
export interface Hash {
    encode(encodedData: string): string;
}
```



A very simple example of such an implementation is
provided for JSON:

````typescript
// noinspection JSAnnotator
/**
 * Bason JSON stringify encryption impl
 */
export class JSONCrypto implements Crypto {

    decode(data: any): any {
        if (data?.encryptedData) {
            return JSON.parse(data.encryptedData);
        }
        return data;
    }

    encode(data: any) {
        return {
            encryptedData: JSON.stringify(data)
        }
    }
}
````
### Usage

The usage comes down to pass a new crypto object
into the constructor for the Broker. For convenience purposes
we have now added builders to make it easier to pass the objects down.
This also comes back to the original idea of mona-dish to provide
monadish functional interfaces.
(as you can see most Broker Methods return the - this object
so that it allows chaining of method calls)

````typescript
let broker = new BroadcastChannelBrokerBuilder()
    .withCrypto(crypto).build()
    .broadcast(...).broadcast(...);
let broker2 = new BroadcastChannelBrokerBuilder().withCrypto(crypto).build();
````

The rest then is handled transparently.

### Crypto Extensions

Here we can find several raw implementations of the basic crypto functionality without
binding ourselves to a specific crypto lib.

For now, we have provided following

* JSONCrypto an implementation for encoding and decoding into JSON
* ExpiringCrypto a crypto decorator which provides an expiration mechanism so that messages and keys can timeout
this is useful for rotating key constructs

See the code for further details and also how to implement your own crypto implementation.
