# Brainstorming for 4.0.1

* Eliminate Streams - done, this was the biggest one
* Reintroduce partial page submit (myfaces.pps?), while never really used - done, pps=true is reintroduced
reducing the commit load onto execute!

queue size reduction... not really needed, there never was a usecase for it
